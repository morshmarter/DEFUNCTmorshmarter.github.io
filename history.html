    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Sexotheque was founded in the 70s which started out as a nightclub in Flan, USA. Because the original building
        was a small inn, the building was also converted into a love hotel. Because of this set up, occasionally the
        staff were dragged into the private affairs of the hotel guests. Encouraging this behavior, the business was
        rebranded in the mid 70s with an emphasis on high quality service and its new hotel status. Eventually the
        business bought its first large scale urban hotel in the late 70s when it established itself as an interactive
        adult entertainment hotel in the red light district of Flan. From there, the rise of a dedicated erotic hotel
        gave rise to itself slowly into the modern world.
        Today the hotel maintains its aesthetic of the original 70s neon glow of the original Sexotheque while adapting
        to the modern clean aesthetic which can be seen in the interior design and staff uniforms.
