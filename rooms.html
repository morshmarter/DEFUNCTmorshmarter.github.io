    <h1>Rooms</h1>
    <p>All guest rooms will guarantee three things: a place to sleep, a place to clean, and privacy. Let us get to know
        the room as if it were a room tour of a generic single room.

        Before even entering the room, the room door has a keycard scanner that just needs the presence of the card in
        hand while the handle of the door is being turned to unlock. There is also an electric buzzer outside the door
        which can be configured to flash the room lights if a guest is potentially deaf. The other side of the door has
        a peephole, a chain (to partially open the door), and an electronic lock. The door can be made to lock itself or
        act as a regular door. There is also an emergency exit map for that specific room as well as buttons to activate
        “do not disturb” which tells the room service to skip over that room and “request room service” which alerts
        room service to that room. Everything can be handled with voice commands through the AI in the room, more on
        that later.

        The walls of the room are soundproof and quakeproof guaranteed. As a result they are also fireproof.

        Light switches nearby control the lighting of all points in the room excluding the bathroom and reading lights,
        which have their own set of light switches. As well as controlling the curtains. Also voice controlled.

        Near the entrance will be the closet. These are compact spaces which will have a closet space, a safe, and a
        shoe rack. The closet space is empty save for a free comfy Sexotheque nightgown per guest and is a nice place to
        hang up any coats or suits. The shoe rack is a place to hold shoes and has some Sexotheque plush slippers also
        free for each guest in a room. The safe is a place to store valuables with a customizable password lock
        utilizing letters and numbers of four to eight symbols long. Inside the safe is also a timed lock safe for any
        time based locking. An ironing board and clothes iron can also be found in the closet though hidden away.

        Getting into the main part of the hotel room, the first point of interest is the bed, with the head of the bed
        on the wall farthest away from us when we enter (for convenience sake). Bed sheets can be customized just how
        you prefer them which can set up during booking. However they usually have clean a fitted sheet, white sheets, a
        thin blanket, layered blanked, duvet, and several pillows by default minimum. Everything on the bed except for
        the fitted sheet is white, to ensure cleanliness and the fitted sheet is for aesthetic.All beds have a built in
        reading light per side. The frame of the bed is made of reinforced steel and have several loops, and bars for
        attaching restraints to.The bed also vibrates and oscillates. Certain places on the frame bed where a strap can
        be attached to can be set up to automatically tighten after some time or detecting some amount of force. This is
        for self bondage or automation reasons. This does not pull hard enough to hurt but it will resist all pulling.
        As such it will pull you to just as much as you allow, leaving no room for relaxing as long as you don’t give
        it. The mattress can be changed out for a waterproof cover but must be done through room service. All services
        described can be done through voice commands. The bed is also optionally underlit to help night time walking.
        This feature can be turned on and off.

        The nightstand is just a normal night stand. The TV remote is located inside the top drawer. Any choice
        literature (chosen when you booked the room) will also be located in the top drawer. On the top is the phone
        which also doubles as an alarm clock. For those that prefer a traditional alarm, you can set one up here.
        Alternatively, a room morning call service is available. The phone communicates between rooms, the front desk
        and can make and receive normal phone calls too. Also on the stand is a phone stand that can charge and use
        bluetooth compatibility to provide interaction between your phone and the room.

        The desk is a normal work desk. You can adjust the height with a switch under the top. There’s a work light with
        adjustable stand.

        The window can be opened all the way and the blinds can be controlled automatically. There are three curtains
        for horizontal and vertical light control. The window is soundproof.

        The bathroom is stocked with 7 different kinds of towels, a free toothbrush and toothpaste, soap bar, lotion,
        wipes, condoms, cotton balls, cups, floss. The toilet has a bidet but toilet paper is four-ply. There are two
        sinks and a full mirror. Depending on the kind of room you got, you either receive a shower or a bathtub. The
        temperature, intensity, pressure, and spray pattern of the water is controllable. Showers come equipped with a
        that simulates rainstorms (with controlled temperature). Bathtubs come equipped with jets can simulate currents.

        The control panel controls the main parts of the room via touch screen. For those that need a more hands on
        approach to the room this is a nice starting place to do so. This is also where the main microphone for voice
        commands are. By default, it shows the 6 most common toggles of the hotel and can be customized to whatever
        needs you may need, such as locking the room, or closing the windows.

    <h2>Modular Room Design</h2>
    <p>Because of the modular notion of the rooms of the hotel, the difference between rooms and suites are usually
        defined by a difference of a few rooms.
        A common feature is the balcony which allows a free hanging space to a hotel room. The railing is composed of
        steel and glass and is bullet and soundproof.
    </p>

    <h2>Ammendities and Services</h2>
    <p>Services are special conditional activities that can be set up for individuals or groups to either convenience or
        enjoyment. Amenities are items that are given to Sexotheque guests either for free or for a cost. These things
        are rented for the duration of the stay and an additional cost will be applied when it is taken.
        The most common hotel service is the wakeup call or alarm call which can be set up by either the AI or the front
        desk at anytime.
