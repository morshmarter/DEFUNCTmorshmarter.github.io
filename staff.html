    <h3>Waterbots</h3>
    <p>Waterbots are originally an office water dispenser that has been redesigned and repurposed. The original
        Waterbots were called Waterbottles. Designed to be a mobile, bipedal liquid dispenser with primitive AI
        technology. They also lacked all the additional designs that go towards a modern Waterbot. The entire product
        was actually rather dull and boring and meant for generic office use. The new Waterbots have been refitted with
        a complete redoing of the entire product.
        Waterbots are majority composed of a firm silicon casing, hard with a bit of give. The model has been improved
        with several LED lights over the glass paneling on the stomach. The teeth have also been reduced, enlarged and
        made to be more appealing. The head frame has also been simplised to be a more stylized form. Other changes were
        the enlarging of the belly and the tail.
        The AI components are located on the “back” of the bot while the tail and the arms operate with soft body
        pneumatics. A majority of the bot is the liquid container which operates also with pneumatics. The quantity of
        liquids that can be stored is extreme to the point of almost cartoonish. This liquid transferred by a straw in
        the belly and exits the head with a straw tongue. The “eye” of the Waterbot is the logo of Sexotheque with the
        arrow always pointing towards the chin drawn on with glow-in-the-dark-paint. Originally done with
        fingerpainting, now done with a professional spray. The inside of the mouth also has a diluted lighting to make
        it glow.
        Waterbots can talk with a speaker in their head. Each one can be programmed with a unique personality and voice.
        Waterbots are battery powered and can be charged by proxy on a charging pad which they have to sit or stand on.
        Waterbots can wear clothes but cannot have any changes to its physiology without being completely rebranded.</p>
