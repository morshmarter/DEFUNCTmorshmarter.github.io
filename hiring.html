    <h1>Now Hiring!</h1>
    <h3>Getting hired</h3>
    <p>Getting hired requires applicants to register either online or in person by first filling out a form that delineates
    all information about you. This information includes your preferred name and gender, address, etc.. Because the
    first couple of days spend training are done on site/on location the address is optional if you prefer to stay
    housed on location.
    Because it is assumed that all applicants are equal until being specialized. The form functions more as a profile of
    each individual staff member. There is a place that is deliberately for writing your sexual preferences, interests,
    and dislikes. This will help you be placed into groups based on your interests. Because there is a high demand for
    physical workforce, there is typically a high chance to be hired as long as they’re looking.
    The final step of training is to sign a waiver that lasts for the duration of training that consents to them to a
    majority of actions done to them. This contract can be renewed after training. The contract can be ended early by a
    “safeword” but doing so will terminate the work contract too.</p>
    <h3>Training</h3>
    <p>Training is done by a corporate trainer, someone who had studied under Athena, the Administrative Corporate Trainer.
    Between three and six months, the staff are taught basic hotelier tasks such as manners, housekeeping, basic
    maintenance, cooking, food servicing. As well as general sexotheque activities such as intercourse, light bondage,
    kink tolerance, and overall hygiene.
    Sexotheque members are groups up in teams of threes which collectively participate in the same activities until each
    one can be assigned a specialization which cause their schedules to branch off.</p>
